## Overview

AquaEye-Sentient is the third cycle of the AquaEye project series — a low-cost, autonomous acoustic buoy system for detecting marine mammal vocalisations in the East Aegean Sea and Mediterranean coastal waters.

The system deploys **HydroMoth hydrophone recorders** on floating buoys to passively record underwater sound. Recordings are compressed, tagged with GPS and water quality metadata, and uploaded to cloud storage when Wi-Fi is available.

This cycle's primary contribution is the first integration of a real underwater acoustic subsystem into the platform. Previous cycles developed the ML classifier and recording pipeline using existing datasets; this cycle integrates, characterises, and deploys HydroMoth hydrophones for the first time.
